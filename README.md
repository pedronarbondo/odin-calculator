This is the last The Odin Project: Foundations project.

We're to design a functioning calculator (UI and logic) by implementing
all of the tools we've learned so far.


It took 59:42s to design the calculator (HTML/CSS) and
about 4/5 hours to code all of the logic. I lost track of how long it took
to write everything JS related, but it was no more than 5 hours. Yay me.

Next up is FullStack Intermediate Javascript.
